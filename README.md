# Modified-Newton-Raphson-Based-Inverse-Kinematics
MATLAB implementation of a real-time robust inverse kinematics algorithm using a modified Jacobian and task-prioritized Newton–Raphson method.


Modified Newton–Raphson (MNR) Based Inverse Kinematics – Example Implementation

This repository provides a simple and self-contained MATLAB example demonstrating how to:

Compute the modified Jacobian matrix

 (Eq. 14) proposed in the associated paper, and

Implement the core Modified Newton–Raphson (MNR) inverse kinematics algorithm using this Jacobian.

The purpose of this repository is educational and illustrative: it is intended to help readers understand the formulation and practical implementation of the proposed IK method.
